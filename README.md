## Creative Tilt

We aim to make an interesting 2D jumping platform game. We stuck for a relatively long time on how to start our programming. 
But I believed we learned lots of things, especially how to make something new or something we want based on the examples in the class.
We made a speed up scene after 15 seconds, which is interesting for us and it is also a programming technic we were interested in before.

We are satisfied with our game's visual style, which corresponds with our game's title. 
And for the sounds we used in our game, we think those sounds blend well with scenes. There is kind of psychedelic style.
